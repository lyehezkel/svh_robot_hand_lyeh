# Change the hand gestures
in order to change the hand gestures, go to the file 'requsted_gestures.py'. then look for the arrays that look like this:
```
def fist():
    #return the value numbers that make a fist
    return [0.44,0.63,1.33,0.8,0.8,1.33,0.98,0.98,0.0]
```
these array sending the vaule for each joint of the hand its value, so if you change the values to your needs you need to source the termianal and start the launch file again.
